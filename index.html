                    News coverage of <a href="https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0054/4525586.pdf"> UFO
                        in 1966
                    </a>
                    were explained as “college student pranks, balloons, stars, or air crafts.” This explanation of the
                    UFO
                    phenomenon covered by the media did not satisfy House Republican Leader Gerald, R. Ford. Mr.Ford
                    having
                    political power was able to file a petition to get the right investigators into the matter and give
                    the
                    American
                    people a congruent answer to the UFO sightings.

                    What Mr.Ford proposed was to have a hearing of key witnesses like personnel part of the executive
                    branch
                    and
                    eye
                    witnesses of the public to testify about the sightings of UFO. His goal was to bring awareness of
                    the
                    issue
                    and
                    shed light into the matter because the American people deserved an explanation.

                    What is project blue book? The air force created a program that investigated and handled UFO
                    reports.
                    The
                    air
                    force hired over 100 “high caliber” non-biased scientist to investigate the UFOs reports. Many
                    universities
                    were
                    involved in this project. The main campus involved was the University of Colorado.
